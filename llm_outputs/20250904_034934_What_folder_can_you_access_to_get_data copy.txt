It sounds like you are going through a very difficult and overwhelming experience right now. It's understandable that you feel embarrassed, ashamed, and anxious about the situation with the film festival. However, it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and faces challenges in life. The key is to learn from these experiences and move forward in a positive way.

In terms of social media, it's important to be honest and authentic about who you are and what you have to offer. If you feel comfortable sharing your story and using it as a way to connect with others, then that could be a valuable approach. However, if you don't feel ready or comfortable doing so, that's okay too. You can still use social media to share your skills and interests without necessarily revealing your past mistakes.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on what feels right for you personally. It might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you process your feelings and develop strategies for moving forward in a healthy way. Remember that it's okay to ask for help and support when needed.
