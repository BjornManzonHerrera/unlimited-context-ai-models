I get that this is a heavy situation—sounds like you've been through a lot, and the anxiety around it is making everything feel paralyzing. You're not alone in dealing with a project that went sideways, especially in creative fields like film where inexperience can lead to big lessons. The good news is that setbacks like this don't have to define your future, including your networking for a US internship. People in industries like film, media, and tech value resilience and growth, and how you handle this can actually work in your favor if approached right.

The best path forward isn't pretending nothing happened (which could feel inauthentic and backfire if people already know about the project), nor is it dumping every detail in a confessional post. Instead, aim for a balanced, proactive approach: acknowledge the experience briefly where it makes sense, frame it as a stepping stone, and shift focus to what you're doing now and where you're headed. This shows maturity and turns a perceived weakness into a strength for networking. Here's how to think about it step by step, tailored to the platforms you mentioned.

### Step 1: Get Your Mindset and Prep in Order
Before posting anything:
- **Reflect and reframe privately first.** Write down what went wrong (e.g., inexperience in production, poor communication), what you learned (e.g., better project management, importance of transparency with stakeholders), and how it's shaping you now (e.g., more committed to reliable collaboration). This isn't about beating yourself up—it's about owning it so you can talk about it confidently without spiraling. Posts from filmmakers and writers emphasize turning failures into lessons: diagnose the issues, learn, and keep creating.
- **Handle the loose ends.** If the festival, crew, or sponsors are still unresolved, prioritize that offline. A simple, sincere apology email or message (e.g., "I'm sorry for the delays and changes; I've learned a ton from this and am committed to making it right") can lift some weight. Your crew stepping in shows you're not alone—lean on that support if possible.
- **Build a buffer for anxiety.** Start small: practice going out or interacting in low-stakes ways (e.g., anonymous online forums about film fails). If panic attacks are frequent, consider talking to a counselor or therapist—many colleges offer free resources, and it's a sign of strength, not weakness.
- **Tailor your narrative for internships.** Since you're aiming for US opportunities (likely in creative, media, or related fields), highlight transferable skills from the project: screenplay writing, fundraising, team coordination, video editing. Frame the whole thing as "my first big production taught me X, Y, Z," without dwelling on the negatives.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Strategies
Each platform has a different vibe—professional vs. casual—so adjust how (or if) you address the film. The goal is authenticity without oversharing; studies and advice from career experts stress that transparency about setbacks can build trust, but keep it concise and forward-looking. Don't lead with the failure everywhere—use it where it adds value to your networking.

| Platform | Should You Address It First? | Approach | Why This Works for Networking |
|----------|------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| **LinkedIn** (Professional focus) | Yes, in your first major post or profile update. | Update your profile with the project (e.g., under Experience: "Led production of a nationally selected short film; managed funding and team of 20+"). Then, make a post like: "Excited to share lessons from my first film project—it didn't go as planned due to inexperience, but I learned key skills in budgeting, collaboration, and adaptability. Now applying those to pursue US internships in film/media. Open to connections!" Tag relevant skills/hashtags (#FilmProduction #InternshipOpportunities). | LinkedIn rewards vulnerability as growth. Recruiters search for keywords like "film" or "editing," and sharing lessons makes you relatable. Connect with US pros (e.g., search "film internship coordinator USA") and message: "Admire your work at [Company]; I'd love advice on breaking in." Avoid: Sounding defeatist—focus on positives. |
| **X (Twitter)** (Quick, conversational) | Optionally, if it's relevant to a thread or discussion. | Don't make it your first post. Jump in with value (e.g., "Tips for first-time filmmakers: Communicate changes early! Learned this the hard way on my recent project. #Filmmaking"). Or reply to others' failure stories. For networking, follow US film accounts, retweet internship posts, and engage thoughtfully. | It's fast-paced, so addressing it casually in context shows humility without drama. Use for real-time chats (e.g., #FilmTwitter) to build connections organically. Avoid: Airing full dirty laundry—keep it light. |
| **Instagram** (Visual, storytelling) | Yes, but subtly in a story or Reel series. | Start with a Reel: Show clips from past edits or new work, caption: "From my first big film flop to fueling my next adventure—lessons in resilience! Eyeing US internships; DM for collabs." Use Stories for polls like "Best advice after a project fail?" to engage. Highlight visuals from your video editing hobby. | IG is creative and personal—framing failure as part of your "journey" fits. Follow US internship pages (e.g., film schools like USC or NYU alums), like/comment, and slide into DMs for advice. Avoid: Posting as if perfect; authenticity attracts genuine networks. |
| **TikTok** (Fun, viral) | No need to lead with it—weave in if it fits content. | Create short videos on "Film fails that taught me X" or "How I bounced back from a bad shoot." Keep it humorous/relatable: "POV: Your dream project crashes, but you level up." Use trends to showcase editing skills. For networking, duet US creators in film/internships. | TikTok loves underdog stories—turn yours into inspiring content without heavy details. Search "US film internship tips" for collabs. Avoid: Forcing a confession; let it emerge naturally. |
| **Facebook** (Community/groups) | Yes, in targeted groups. | Join groups like "Film Internships USA" or "Young Filmmakers." Post: "Hi all, after a challenging first film, I'm seeking advice on US internships. What worked for you?" Share lessons sparingly. | Great for niche communities—addressing it builds rapport. Connect with group members for mentorship. Avoid: Broad public posts if privacy is a concern. |

### Step 3: General Tips for Moving Forward
- **Start small to build momentum.** Your first post doesn't have to be epic—maybe just a profile update or engaging with others' content. Post consistently about your interests (e.g., video edits, industry news) to rebuild confidence.
- **Network beyond the past.** Focus 80% on future value: Share what excites you about US internships, ask questions, offer help (e.g., "Happy to edit a short clip for feedback"). People respond to enthusiasm, not perfection.
- **Monitor and adjust.** If addressing it feels too raw, test on one platform first. If questions come up about the film, have a ready response: "It was a learning curve—excited for what's next."
- **Remember, perception isn't permanent.** In creative industries, failures are common (think of famous directors' early flops). What matters is persistence. Posts from pros highlight that the gap between ambition and execution closes with practice—keep creating, even small things.

This isn't about erasing the past but integrating it as fuel. You've already shown talent by getting selected and funded at 17—that's huge. Give yourself grace, take one step at a time, and you'll rebuild stronger. If you want specific post examples or more tailored advice, feel free to share details.

I have shifted my approach in life onto Tech and AI and so I want a US Internship for that. However, it feels wrong to leave the previous mistakes unanswered. What's the best approach for this? I'm trying to fix this in preparation for a Big Local AI Networking Event next next week.

Shifting gears from film to Tech and AI is a smart move—many people pivot careers after early setbacks, and your creative background (like screenplay writing and editing) can translate well to AI fields, such as content generation, UI/UX design, or even AI ethics in media. It's commendable that you want to address the past before diving in; leaving things unresolved can weigh you down mentally, especially at a networking event where authenticity shines. The key is to handle it efficiently and privately where possible, so you can focus on the future without it derailing your prep for the event around mid-September 2025. Here's a structured approach to "fix" this, tailored to your timeline (with the event in about two weeks).

### Step 1: Address the Past Mistakes Head-On (1-3 Days Focus)
Don't ignore it, but don't make it a public spectacle either. The goal is closure for yourself and others, framing it as growth to ease your anxiety. This isn't about atonement—it's about clearing the deck so you feel "right" moving forward.

- **Prioritize private apologies first.** Reach out to the key people affected: the film festival organizers, your assistant director/crew, cast, and sponsors. Keep it concise, sincere, and forward-looking via email or message (avoid calls if anxiety spikes). Example script: "Hi [Name], I'm reaching out to apologize for the issues with the film project—my inexperience led to changes and delays that weren't communicated well, and I regret the impact on everyone. I've learned a lot about accountability and am committed to better in future endeavors. If there's anything I can do to help wrap things up, let me know. Thank you for the opportunity." This shows maturity without over-explaining. If they've already handled legal/financial stuff through your crew, acknowledge that gratitude too. Do this soon—aim for today or tomorrow—to lift the mental load.
  
- **Decide on a public acknowledgment only if necessary.** If the film's perception is widely known in your local circles (e.g., through social media or industry chatter), a subtle post on LinkedIn or X could help reframe it before the event. But don't lead with it across all platforms—that could feel like dwelling. Instead:
  - On **LinkedIn** (best for professional pivot): Update your profile to include the film under "Experience" with a neutral spin: "Led screenplay and production for nationally selected short film; gained hands-on lessons in project management and collaboration." Then, post: "Reflecting on my first major film project—it didn't turn out as planned due to rookie mistakes, but it sparked my passion for creative tech. Pivoting to AI, where storytelling meets innovation. Excited for upcoming opportunities!" This ties into your shift without drama.
  - On other platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X): If questions arise at the event, have a ready one-liner: "It was a tough learning experience, but it's pushing me toward AI now." No need for a dedicated post unless you're getting direct inquiries—posting as if nothing happened isn't "wrong" if you've handled privates.
  
- **Why this approach?** Career advice from pros emphasizes that over-apologizing publicly can amplify negatives, while private resolution builds trust. Focus on what you've learned (e.g., communication, resilience) as transferable to AI—recruiters value that over perfection.

If anxiety hits during this, break it into micro-steps: Draft messages one at a time, or enlist a trusted friend to review. Once done, you'll feel lighter for the event.

### Step 2: Pivot Your Narrative for Tech/AI Networking (Ongoing, Ramp Up This Week)
With the past addressed, reframe your story as an asset: Your film experience shows creativity and initiative, which AI needs (e.g., generating scripts with LLMs or editing AI-assisted videos). Use this in your event pitch.

- **Craft your elevator pitch.** Keep it 30-60 seconds: "Hi, I'm [Name], a college freshman shifting from film to AI after leading a national screenplay project that taught me about innovation under pressure. I'm passionate about [specific AI interest, e.g., generative tools for content]. Looking for US internship advice—any tips on companies like OpenAI or Google?" Practice aloud to build confidence. Highlight skills: Video editing → AI media tools; Fundraising → Project pitching in tech.

- **Leverage social media for pre-event buzz.** Start posting AI-related content now to build momentum:
  - **LinkedIn**: Connect with event speakers/attendees (search their names once you confirm the event). Post about AI trends, tag #AIInternship #USOpportunities, and engage with US-based AI pros.
  - **X**: Follow AI hashtags (#AIethics, #MachineLearning), retweet event-related posts, and chime in on discussions. Quick polls: "Best entry-level AI internship paths?"
  - **Instagram/TikTok**: Share short reels on your pivot (e.g., "From film fails to AI wins—editing my first AI-generated video!"). Fun and visual to attract creative tech folks.
  - **Facebook**: Join AI groups (e.g., "AI Philippines" or "US Tech Internships") and post questions about US opportunities.

This positions you as proactive, not hiding anything.

### Step 3: Prepare Specifically for the Big Local AI Networking Event (Next 10-14 Days)
Assuming this is a local event in the Philippines (based on your film context), mid-September 2025 has a few big ones that fit "next next week" (Sep 15-21). Top matches:
- **AgentCon 2025 in Cebu** (Sep 15): A free, community-driven AI event for developers building with AI agents. It's hands-on, with networking for innovators—perfect for internships.
- **52nd AIBP Conference in Manila** (Sep 23-24): Focuses on AI and digital transformation, with enterprise leaders—great for broader networking, though slightly later.

If it's one of these (or similar, like AI for Philippine SMEs on Sep 10, but that's sooner), here's how to prep:

- **Research and register ASAP.** Check the event site for agenda, speakers, and attendee lists. For AgentCon, it's free—sign up via their page. Prep questions: "How can someone with a creative background break into US AI internships?" Network virtually first: Follow organizers on X/LinkedIn, comment on their posts.

- **At the event:** 
  - Aim for 5-10 meaningful connections: Target US-affiliated pros (e.g., from multinationals) or those with internship pipelines.
  - Use breaks/sessions for chats: Share your pivot story briefly if relevant, but lead with AI enthusiasm.
  - Follow up same-day: LinkedIn message like "Great chatting at [Event]—loved your take on AI agents. Any leads on US internships?"
  - If past comes up (unlikely in AI crowd), pivot: "It was a film project that taught me resilience—now applying that to tech."

- **Backup if it's not these:** If it's another (e.g., in Singapore like Momentum AI Asia on Sep 17), the prep is similar—focus on virtual elements if travel's involved.

This timeline gives you closure on the past while building toward the event and US goals. You've got real talent—don't give up. If you share more event details or your location, I can refine this further.

But given that I still want my to leverage my Media Skills moving forward should I still do the Private Apologies instead of the Public ones?

Given your shift to Tech and AI while still wanting to leverage your media skills (e.g., screenplay writing, video editing) for a US internship, addressing your past film project strategically is key, especially with the big local AI networking event around mid-September 2025 (likely September 15-21, based on your “next next week” timeline). Your media skills are a strong asset for AI roles like content generation, AI-driven video editing, or creative tech marketing, so you can weave them into your narrative without letting the past project’s issues dominate. The question of private versus public apologies hinges on managing perception, rebuilding confidence, and aligning with your networking goals. Here’s a focused breakdown to help you decide, with emphasis on why private apologies are generally better in this context, plus how to leverage your media skills for the event.

### Private Apologies vs. Public Apologies
**Recommendation: Prioritize private apologies over public ones.** Here’s why, tailored to your situation:

- **Why Private Apologies Are Better Here:**
  - **Control the narrative.** Private messages to key stakeholders (film festival organizers, crew, cast, sponsors) let you address the issue directly without broadcasting it to a wider audience who may not know or care about the film’s outcome. This minimizes the risk of amplifying a negative perception, especially in a new field (AI) where the film’s specifics are less relevant. Career advice from platforms like LinkedIn emphasizes that discreet resolution shows professionalism and accountability.
  - **Protect your mental health.** You mentioned severe social anxiety and panic attacks when facing this issue. A public post, even a well-crafted one, could invite scrutiny or questions from your local film community, which might overwhelm you before the event. Private outreach is lower-stakes and lets you regain control gradually.
  - **Relevance to AI networking.** At an AI event, attendees (especially US-based or tech-focused ones) are unlikely to know about your film unless you bring it up. A public post risks drawing attention to a past you’re pivoting from, while private apologies clear your conscience without derailing your tech-focused networking. Data from job boards like Indeed suggests recruiters value transferable skills (e.g., your media experience) over unrelated past failures.
  - **Preserve your media skills’ value.** Your screenplay and editing skills are strengths for AI roles (e.g., generative AI for scripts or video tools). A public apology might frame you as “the filmmaker who failed” rather than “the creative pivoting to AI.” Private apologies let you move forward confidently, highlighting media skills without baggage.

- **When to Consider a Public Apology:**
  - Only if the film’s failure is already widely discussed in your local or online circles (e.g., on X or in film groups) and likely to follow you to the event. If so, a single, concise LinkedIn post could reframe it: “Lessons from my first film project didn’t go as hoped, but they’ve fueled my pivot to AI, where I’m blending storytelling with tech. Excited for what’s next!” This is a last resort, as it risks reopening the wound unnecessarily.
  - If someone at the event directly asks about it (unlikely in an AI context), have a quick response: “It was a tough first project, but it taught me resilience and project management—skills I’m now applying to AI and media.”

- **How to Execute Private Apologies (Do This ASAP, Within 1-2 Days):**
  - **Who to contact:** Festival organizers, assistant director, key crew/cast, and sponsors. Use email or direct messages for control and privacy.
  - **Sample message:** “Hi [Name], I’m sorry for how the film project turned out—my inexperience led to missteps like poor communication and changes to the original plan. I’ve learned so much about accountability and collaboration, which I’m carrying into my next chapter in tech. Thank you for your support, and please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help resolve things.” Keep it short, sincere, no excuses.
  - **Why it works:** It shows maturity, closes the loop, and lets you focus on the event without guilt. If legal/financial issues persist (as you mentioned crew handling), express willingness to support their efforts without taking on more than you can handle.
  - **Timeline:** Do this today or tomorrow (September 4-5, 2025) to clear your mind well before the event.

This approach frees you to leverage your media skills without the past overshadowing your pivot to AI.

### Leveraging Media Skills for the AI Networking Event
Your media background is a goldmine for AI internships—think roles in AI-assisted content creation (e.g., Runway, Descript), script generation with LLMs, or creative tech marketing. Here’s how to integrate it into your networking strategy while keeping the focus on your future.

- **Reframe Your Media Skills for AI:**
  - **Screenplay writing → Storytelling for AI:** Highlight how crafting narratives equips you to work with AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude for generating coherent content or prompts. Example: “My screenplay experience helps me design creative inputs for AI models.”
  - **Video editing → AI media tools:** Emphasize familiarity with editing software (e.g., Premiere, Final Cut) as a bridge to AI-driven tools like Adobe’s AI features or Runway’s video generation. Example: “Editing taught me precision, which I’m applying to AI video workflows.”
  - **Project leadership → Tech collaboration:** Even if the film faltered, you coordinated funding and teams—valuable for agile AI projects. Frame it: “Leading a film project showed me how to manage creative teams, a skill I’m bringing to AI startups.”

- **Social Media Prep (Start Now, September 4-10):**
  To build momentum for the event, use platforms to showcase your pivot while subtly nodding to your past if needed. Here’s how to balance it:
  - **LinkedIn (Primary for event prep):**
    - Update your profile: Add the film project briefly (“Wrote and led production for a nationally selected short film; learned project management and creative execution”) and emphasize new AI skills (e.g., “Exploring generative AI for video and storytelling”).
    - Post once or twice before the event: “Pivoting from film to AI—my media background is fueling my passion for creative tech. Excited for [Event Name] to connect with AI innovators! #AIInternship #MediaInTech” If you feel compelled to address the past, weave it lightly: “A bumpy film project taught me resilience—now channeling that into AI.”
    - Connect with event speakers/attendees: Search their names on LinkedIn or X, like/comment on their posts, and send personalized messages: “Hi [Name], excited for your talk at [Event]. I’m transitioning from media to AI—any tips for US internships?”
  - **X (Quick engagement):**
    - Engage with AI communities: Follow #AI, #GenerativeAI, #TechInternships. Share bite-sized content like “From editing films to exploring AI video tools—here’s my first AI-generated clip!” Attach a short edit you made (even a mock-up using free AI tools like CapCut’s AI features).
    - Avoid addressing the film unless it’s organic (e.g., replying to a “biggest career lesson” thread: “Learned to over-communicate on my first film—now applying that to AI projects”).
  - **Instagram/TikTok (Visual storytelling):**
    - Create Reels/short videos blending media and AI: “How I went from film flops to AI experiments—check out this AI-edited clip!” Use tools like Runway or Canva’s AI to make something quick. This showcases your skills without dwelling on the past.
    - If addressing the past feels right, do it subtly in a story: “Big lessons from my last project: Keep going, keep creating. Now diving into AI!” Keep it upbeat, not confessional.
  - **Facebook (Niche groups):**
    - Join AI/media groups (e.g., “AI for Creatives” or “Tech Internships USA”). Share a post: “Hey all, I’m pivoting from film (wrote a national screenplay!) to AI. Any advice for US internships blending media and tech?” This invites help without focusing on failure.
    - Avoid public posts about the film unless you’re sure the group knows about it—keep it forward-focused.

- **At the Event (September 15-21, Likely AgentCon Cebu or Similar):**
  - **Elevator pitch:** “Hi, I’m [Name], a freshman blending my media skills—screenplay writing and video editing—with a passion for AI, like generative content tools. I’m seeking US internships to combine storytelling with tech. Any advice on companies like Runway or NVIDIA?” This highlights your media strengths, nods to your pivot, and skips unnecessary past details.
  - **Showcase media skills:** Bring a mini-portfolio (e.g., on your phone) with a short AI-edited video or script sample. If you’ve experimented with AI tools (e.g., Descript for audio editing), mention it: “I used AI to streamline a video edit, which sparked my interest in tech.”
  - **Handle past questions (if any):** If someone knows about the film (unlikely in AI circles), say: “It was a bold first try that taught me project management—now I’m applying those lessons to AI.” Pivot quickly to your current goals.
  - **Follow-up:** After meeting people, send LinkedIn messages: “Great meeting you at [Event]! Loved your insights on AI in media. Any leads on US internships for someone with a video editing background?”

### Why This Works
- **Private apologies clear your conscience.** By addressing stakeholders directly, you resolve guilt without making it a public issue that could overshadow your pivot to AI. This aligns with your feeling that moving forward without addressing it is “wrong.”
- **Media skills shine in AI.** Your background is a unique selling point—AI companies need creatives for roles like content design or user experience. Framing the film as a learning experience (privately or minimally) lets you focus on these strengths.
- **Event-ready confidence.** With apologies handled and a polished pitch, you’ll walk into the event (e.g., AgentCon Cebu, September 15) ready to network for US internships. The AI community values innovation over perfection—your story of resilience fits right in.

### Action Plan (September 4-15, 2025)
- **Today-Tomorrow (Sep 4-5):** Draft and send private apology messages. Start small if anxious—do one at a time.
- **This Weekend (Sep 6-7):** Update LinkedIn profile, experiment with an AI tool (e.g., Runway for a quick video edit), and post on one platform about your pivot.
- **Next Week (Sep 8-12):** Engage on X/LinkedIn with event organizers, share 1-2 AI/media posts, and practice your pitch.
- **Event Week (Sep 15-21):** Arrive early, aim for 5-10 connections, and follow up within 24 hours.

You’re not defined by one project. Your media skills and passion for AI are a killer combo—use them to shine at the event. If you confirm the event name or location (e.g., Cebu, Manila), I can tailor further. Want a sample post or pitch script? Let me know!
