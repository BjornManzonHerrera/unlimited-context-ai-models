To secure a US internship with an International Guest, you could discuss the following topics:

1. **Crypto**: You could talk about your interest in cryptocurrency and its potential applications in AI, highlighting any relevant projects or research you've conducted.
2. **The Job Market**: Discuss the current job market trends in the US, particularly in the field of AI, and how they relate to your skills and interests.
3. **Watches** (and other unrelated topics): It's unlikely that discussing watches would be directly relevant to securing a US internship in AI. However, if you're asked about it, you could pivot by saying something like: "I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and design in smartwatches. Similarly, I'm excited about the potential of AI to transform industries."
4. **Cars** (and other unrelated topics): Similar to watches, discussing cars might not be directly relevant to securing a US internship in AI. If asked, you could pivot by saying something like: "I've always been interested in how autonomous vehicles are being developed with AI technologies. I'm excited about the potential of AI to transform industries."
5. **The US**: You could discuss your interest in working in the US and what you know about the country's tech industry.
6. **AI**: This is a great topic! Discuss your interests, skills, and experiences related to AI, highlighting any relevant projects or research you've conducted.

**Preparation Tips**:

- Follow the organizers of the event on LinkedIn and comment on their posts to establish a connection before the event.
- Prepare questions like "How can someone with a creative background break into US AI internships?" or "What are some current trends in AI that I should be aware of?"
- Be prepared to share your pivot story briefly if relevant, but lead with AI enthusiasm.

**Post-Event Follow-up**:

- Send LinkedIn messages after meeting people, saying something like: "Great meeting you at [Event]! Loved your insights on AI in media. Any leads on US internships for someone with a video editing background?"
- If past comes up (unlikely in an AI crowd), pivot by saying something like: "It was a film project that taught me resilienceâ€”now applying that to tech."
