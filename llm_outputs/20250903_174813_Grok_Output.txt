Below is a general overview of how to prepare for each of the scenarios you listed: reconnecting with students and teachers, negotiating a media pass, conversing with international "whales" (high-value contacts or investors), discussing a U.S. internship, negotiating locally funded opportunities, and preparing for black swans (rare, high-impact risks). Each section provides key preparation steps, tailored to the context, drawing on best practices for relationship-building, negotiation, and risk mitigation. I’ll keep it concise while ensuring actionable insights, incorporating principles like those from *Never Split the Difference* where relevant (e.g., tactical empathy, calibrated questions). Since the context for some scenarios is vague, I’ll make reasonable assumptions and offer to refine if you provide more details.

### 1. Prep for Reconnecting with Students and Teachers
**Context**: Likely reconnecting with academic contacts (e.g., former classmates, professors, or colleagues) for networking, collaboration, or event-related purposes (e.g., AI event coverage).

- **Define Your Goal**: Clarify why you’re reconnecting (e.g., invite them to the AI event, seek insights for coverage, or build long-term relationships). Be specific (e.g., “Get Professor X to introduce me to the event’s keynote speaker”).
- **Research Contacts**: Check LinkedIn or X for recent updates on their work, publications, or AI interests. Note shared history (e.g., “We took AI Ethics together in 2023”).
- **Craft a Personalized Outreach**: Use email or LinkedIn for initial contact. Reference past interactions and align with their interests (e.g., “I know you’re passionate about AI ethics—thought you’d be interested in [event]”). Suggest a quick coffee or virtual chat.
- **Prepare Talking Points**: Share your current work (e.g., “I’m covering [AI event] for [outlet]”) and ask about theirs (e.g., “What’s new with your AI research?”). Offer value (e.g., share event insights or connect them to others).
- **Logistics**: Schedule meetings 2–3 weeks out. Have a notebook or tablet to jot down their updates. Follow up with a thank-you email and share any promised resources.
- **Empathy Approach**: Use *Never Split the Difference* labeling (e.g., “It seems like you’re deep into AI research these days”) to build rapport and encourage sharing.

### 2. Prep for Negotiating Media Pass
**Context**: Securing a complimentary media pass for a local AI event via a personal connect, likely in a face-to-face (F2F) meeting.

- **Establish Credentials**: Affiliate with a media outlet (e.g., blog, newsletter, or X account with 1,000+ followers). Prepare a portfolio (digital or printed) with 3–5 AI-related articles or posts. Have an editor’s letter if freelance.
- **Research the Event**: Study the agenda, speakers, and sponsors on the event website or X. Tailor your coverage plan (e.g., “I’ll highlight the generative AI panel for my 2,000 tech readers”).
- **Know Your Connect**: Check their role (e.g., organizer, sponsor) via LinkedIn or X. Understand their goals (e.g., event visibility). Use this to frame your pitch (e.g., “My coverage can boost sponsor exposure”).
- **Pitch Preparation**: Practice a 2-minute pitch: introduce yourself, state the media pass ask, and emphasize mutual benefits (e.g., “My X posts can reach 5,000 AI enthusiasts”). Anticipate objections (e.g., “Passes are limited”) and prepare responses (e.g., “Could a partial pass work?”).
- **Voss Techniques**: Use *Never Split the Difference* principles:
  - **Accusation Audit**: “You might think I’m just after a free ticket.”
  - **Mirroring**: Repeat their last 1–3 words (e.g., “Limited passes?”) to keep them talking.
  - **Calibrated Questions**: “How can my coverage align with your goals?”
- **Logistics**: Bring a phone/tablet with portfolio, dress professionally, and confirm the meeting spot (e.g., coffee shop). Send a thank-you email within 24 hours.

### 3. Prep for Convo with International Whales
**Context**: “Whales” likely refer to high-value international contacts (e.g., AI industry leaders, investors, or conference speakers) you’ll meet at the event or via your network.

- **Identify the Whales**: Research key attendees or contacts via the event website, X, or LinkedIn. Note their roles (e.g., “CEO of AI startup”), recent achievements, or interests (e.g., “Invested in AI healthcare”).
- **Set Objectives**: Decide what you want (e.g., pitch an article, secure a mentorship, or explore collaboration). Be realistic—whales prioritize value, so focus on their needs.
- **Craft Your Elevator Pitch**: Prepare a 30-second intro: who you are, what you do (e.g., “I cover AI trends for [outlet]”), and a hook (e.g., “I’d love to feature your work on [AI topic]”). Tailor it to their interests.
- **Cultural Awareness**: Research their cultural background (e.g., communication norms in Japan vs. Germany). For example, be direct with Americans, but more formal with East Asian contacts.
- **Voss Techniques**:
  - **Labeling**: “It seems like you’re focused on scaling AI solutions.”
  - **Calibrated Questions**: “What’s the biggest challenge you’re tackling in AI right now?”
  - **No-Oriented Questions**: “Would it be a bad idea to share your insights with my audience?”
- **Logistics**: Schedule meetings (if pre-arranged) or approach at the event (e.g., during networking breaks). Have business cards and a digital portfolio ready. Follow up via email or X within 48 hours, referencing the conversation.

### 4. Prep for U.S. Internship Talk
**Context**: Likely discussing a U.S.-based internship opportunity (e.g., in AI, tech, or media) with a recruiter, professor, or employer.

- **Research the Internship**: Check the company’s website, X posts, or Glassdoor for details on the role, team, and culture. Note key skills (e.g., Python, AI ethics) and align with your experience.
- **Prepare Your Pitch**: Highlight 2–3 relevant skills or projects (e.g., “I built an AI chatbot for a class project”). Emphasize enthusiasm for their mission (e.g., “Your work on AI accessibility is inspiring”).
- **Anticipate Questions**: Practice answers for common questions (e.g., “Why this internship?” or “What’s your experience with [tool]?”). Be ready to discuss visa status if international.
- **Voss Techniques**:
  - **Mirroring**: Repeat their key words (e.g., “Team collaboration?”) to build rapport.
  - **Labeling**: “It sounds like you’re looking for someone passionate about AI innovation.”
  - **Calibrated Questions**: “How does your team measure success for interns?”
- **Logistics**: Dress business casual, bring a resume, and have a portfolio (e.g., GitHub for AI projects). If virtual, test your tech setup. Follow up with a thank-you email, reiterating your fit.

### 6. Prep for Any Black Swans
**Context**: Black swans are rare, high-impact risks that could disrupt your plans across these scenarios (e.g., event cancellation, connect’s unreliability, or funding rejection).

- **Anticipate Risks**:
  - **Reconnecting**: Contact ghosts you or lacks influence (10–15% likelihood).
  - **Media Pass**: Passes are full or restricted to major outlets (20% likelihood).
  - **Whales**: They’re unresponsive or dismissive (15% likelihood).
  - **Internship**: Role is filled or visa issues arise (10% likelihood).
  - **Funding**: Budget is cut or priorities shift (15% likelihood).
- **General Mitigation Strategies**:
  - **Research Backup Options**: Identify alternatives (e.g., virtual event access, other internships, or different funders). Check X for real-time updates (e.g., event changes).
  - **Use Voss Techniques**:
    - **Labeling**: Acknowledge disruptions (e.g., “It seems like the event’s plans shifted unexpectedly”).
    - **Calibrated Questions**: “How can we work around this challenge?” or “Who else could help with this?”
    - **No-Oriented Questions**: “Would it be unreasonable to explore [alternative]?”
  - **Build a Network Buffer**: Connect with multiple contacts (e.g., other event organizers, professors, or funders) to reduce reliance on one person.
  - **Plan B**: For each scenario, have a fallback (e.g., cover the event via X, apply for other internships, or seek crowdfunding).
- **Logistics**: Monitor X and event websites for last-minute changes. Keep a contact list and follow up persistently but politely.

### General Tips Across Scenarios
- **Time Management**: Start prep 4–6 weeks out for events, funding, or internships; 1–2 weeks for reconnections or whale convos.
- **Empathy and Listening**: Use *Never Split the Difference* principles (mirroring, labeling, calibrated questions) to build trust and navigate objections in all scenarios.
- **Follow-Up**: Send thank-you emails within 24–48 hours, referencing specific points from each conversation. Deliver on promises (e.g., share coverage, send a proposal).
- **Tech Prep**: Have a phone/tablet with portfolio, resume, or proposal ready. Test virtual meeting tools if needed.
- **Ethics**: Be transparent about your goals (e.g., don’t promise coverage you can’t deliver). Missteps can harm future opportunities.
