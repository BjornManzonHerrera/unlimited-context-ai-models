Navigating conversations with international guests at the AI networking event (likely September 15-21, 2025, e.g., AgentCon Cebu) to secure a US internship in Tech/AI, while leveraging your media skills (screenplay writing, video editing), requires a strategic approach. You want to come across as engaging, knowledgeable, and authentic, using topics like crypto, the job market, watches, cars, the US, and AI to build rapport and showcase your fit for internships. Given your recent pivot from a challenging film project and your social anxiety, the key is to prepare concise talking points that tie these topics to your goals, avoid over-apologizing for the past, and focus on your enthusiasm for Tech/AI. Below, I’ll outline how to discuss each topic with international guests (e.g., US-based AI professionals, recruiters, or mentors) to make a strong impression and network effectively for a US internship. I’ll also integrate your media skills and address how to handle these conversations given your context.

### General Strategy for Conversations
- **Goal:** Build rapport, show curiosity, and subtly pitch your internship interest by connecting each topic to your skills and Tech/AI aspirations.
- **Approach:** Use a three-step formula: **Listen, Relate, Pivot.**
  - **Listen:** Ask open-ended questions to understand the guest’s perspective (e.g., their work, interests).
  - **Relate:** Share a brief personal connection (e.g., your media skills, pivot story) to show relevance.
  - **Pivot:** Steer the conversation to your internship goal, emphasizing your media-to-AI transition.
- **Anxiety management:** Practice 1-2 talking points per topic with a friend (as you’re doing with apologies). Keep responses short (30-60 seconds) to avoid feeling overwhelmed. If panic hits, excuse yourself briefly (e.g., “I’ll grab a drink, be right back”) and breathe deeply.
- **Tie to media skills:** Highlight how your screenplay writing (storytelling, creativity) and video editing (technical precision, visual communication) apply to AI roles like content generation or media tech.
- **Avoid the film project unless asked:** As discussed, your private apologies to the crew (e.g., Renean’s group talk) should clear your conscience. Only mention the film if directly relevant (e.g., “It taught me resilience, which I’m applying to AI”).

### Talking Points for Each Topic
Here’s how to discuss crypto, the job market, watches, cars, the US, and AI with international guests to build connections and angle for a US internship. Each includes a sample question, a way to relate it to your background, and a pivot to your internship goal. I’ve used insights from web sources (e.g., crypto job trends, AI career advice) to ground the advice in current realities.

#### 1. Crypto
- **Why it’s relevant:** Crypto intersects with AI (e.g., AI for blockchain analytics, DeFi prediction models). Your media skills can tie to crypto marketing or content creation for Web3 startups. The crypto job market is competitive but growing, with a 60% year-over-year increase in postings as of 2025 ().[](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/08/19/how-college-graduates-can-break-into-crypto-and-ai-careers/)
- **How to talk about it:**
  - **Question:** “What’s the most exciting crossover you’re seeing between AI and crypto, like in DeFi or NFT platforms?”
  - **Relate:** “I’ve been exploring crypto through my media lens—my screenplay writing helps me think about storytelling for Web3 projects, like creating engaging content for blockchain startups.”
  - **Pivot:** “I’m really interested in US internships that blend AI and crypto, especially in content or analytics. Are there companies you’d recommend for someone with my creative background?”
- **Why it works:** Shows curiosity about a hot intersection (AI + crypto), ties your media skills to crypto marketing, and opens the door to internship leads. Avoid jargon overload—focus on your interest, not deep expertise.
- **If they ask about your film:** “It was a learning curve that taught me project management, which I’m now applying to tech fields like crypto and AI.”

#### 2. The Job Market
- **Why it’s relevant:** The tech job market is tough, with AI displacing some entry-level roles (unemployment for recent graduates at 5.8% in 2025,). Your media skills and pivot story show resilience, a key trait for internships. Discussing the market signals you’re aware of trends.[](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/ai-jobs-college-graduates.html)

  - **Relate:** “I love how watches tell a story through design—my screenplay background makes me think about branding for tech products like wearables.”
  - **Pivot:** “I’d love to work on AI-driven design or marketing for tech products in the US. Any companies you know hiring interns in that space?”
- **Why it works:** It’s a light, personal topic that builds connection, letting you pivot to AI and media skills. If they’re not into watches, switch to another topic.
- **If film comes up:** “My film experience taught me attention to detail, which I’m applying to tech design ideas now.”

#### 4. Cars
- **Why it’s relevant:** Cars tie to AI through autonomous driving, EV tech, or automotive marketing. Your video editing skills can apply to AI-driven car ads or visualizations. The topic can appeal to guests interested in tech or luxury.

#### 6. AI
- **Why it’s relevant:** This is your core focus and the event’s theme (e.g., AgentCon Cebu). Your media skills directly apply to AI roles in content generation, video tools, or marketing. AI job postings jumped 59% in 2025, with demand for creative-technical hybrids ().[](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/08/19/how-college-graduates-can-break-into-crypto-and-ai-careers/)

- **If film comes up:** “My film project was a crash course in project management—now I’m using those skills to dive into AI.”

### Handling the Film Project in Conversations
Since you’re resolving the film’s fallout privately (e.g., group talk with Renean), avoid bringing it up unless asked. If it comes up:
- **Keep it brief:** “My first film didn’t go as planned—my inexperience led to mistakes, but it taught me resilience and collaboration, which I’m applying to AI.”
- **Pivot to AI:** “That experience pushed me to explore AI, where I’m using my editing skills for tools like Descript.”
This keeps the focus on your future, not the past. Your private apologies should ease guilt, letting you talk confidently.

### Tips for the AI Networking Event (September 15-21)
- **Prep talking points:** Practice 1-2 points per topic with your friend (as you’re doing for apologies). Keep each to 30-60 seconds to stay concise.
- **Start small:** Approach 1-2 guests early (e.g., during a coffee break) with a light topic (watches, cars) to build confidence, then shift to AI or the job market.
- **Showcase media skills:** Bring a phone with a quick AI-edited video (e.g., 15 seconds using Runway) to show if AI or media comes up. Say: “I made this with AI to test my editing skills—pretty cool!”
- **Follow up:** After meeting guests, send LinkedIn messages: “Great talking about [topic] at [Event Name]! I’m exploring US AI internships—any leads for someone with media skills?” Attach your portfolio if relevant.
- **Anxiety management:** If overwhelmed, step away briefly. Focus on listening to guests’ stories to take pressure off yourself.

### Action Plan (September 6-15, 2025)
- **Today (Sep 6):** Finalize group apology with Renean (as discussed). Practice 1-2 talking points per topic with your friend.
- **Tomorrow (Sep 7):** Create a 15-second AI-edited video for your portfolio. Post on LinkedIn/X: “Excited for [Event Name] to explore AI in media! #AIInternship”
- **This Week (Sep 8-12):** Engage with event speakers on LinkedIn/X (comment on their posts). Practice full pitch: “I’m pivoting from film to AI, using my media skills for content creation.”
- **Event Week (Sep 15-21):** Approach 5-10 guests, starting with light topics (watches, cars), then pivoting to AI/internships. Follow up within 24 hours.

Your media skills and pivot story make you a unique candidate—use these topics to show it. If you want specific phrases for a guest (e.g., a recruiter vs. a tech founder) or more portfolio ideas, share details, and I’ll tailor further. Which topic feels easiest to start with?
