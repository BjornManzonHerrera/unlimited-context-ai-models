Feeling conflicted about posting on social media is super common, especially when you’re pivoting to a new field like Tech/AI, preparing for a big networking event (likely September 15-21, 2025), and trying to leverage your media skills for a US internship while carrying the weight of a past film project. The ease of posting can make it feel like your thoughts might get lost in the noise or lack originality, but that’s a trap—your unique perspective, even if influenced by what you consume, still has value. In creative and tech fields, authenticity and consistent engagement matter more than being 100% unique. The best approach is to share thoughtfully, focusing on your journey, skills, and curiosity, while avoiding the pressure to be “precious” or perfect. Here’s a breakdown of how to navigate this, tailored to your goals of networking for a US internship in Tech/AI and blending your media skills (screenplay writing, video editing) into your social media presence.

### Why You Feel Conflicted
- **Ease of posting:** Social media platforms (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook) make it so easy to share that it can feel like everyone’s doing it, leading to self-doubt about whether your posts add value. This is amplified by your anxiety about the film project’s perception, making you hesitant to appear inauthentic or “unforgivable” by posting casually.
- **Uniqueness concern:** You’re aware that your thoughts might echo what you’ve consumed (e.g., YouTube, games, cartoons as a kid; now AI/tech content). This is normal—nobody’s fully original. Studies on creativity (e.g., from psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi) show innovation often comes from remixing existing ideas through your unique lens.
- **Value question:** With your pivot to Tech/AI, you might wonder if your media background or current thoughts are relevant to a tech audience. But your film experience (despite its challenges) and enthusiasm for AI are exactly what can set you apart, especially for roles blending creativity and tech.

### Best Approach to Posting on Social Media
The goal is to post with intention, not perfection, to build a presence that supports your networking for the AI event and US internship applications. Your media skills are a unique asset—use them to share content that’s authentic, engaging, and tied to your Tech/AI pivot. Here’s how to approach it across platforms, addressing your fear of being “unprecious” or unoriginal.

#### 1. Reframe Your Mindset: Value Over Uniqueness
- **You don’t need to be fully unique.** Your perspective—coming from a film background, learning from a high-stakes project, and pivoting to AI—is inherently distinct. Posts from career coaches on LinkedIn emphasize that authenticity (sharing your journey, even the messy parts) resonates more than polished originality.
- **Focus on providing value.** Value comes from sharing insights, asking questions, or showcasing skills that align with your goals. For example:
  - **Showcase skills:** Share a quick video edit using an AI tool (e.g., Runway, CapCut) to demonstrate your media expertise for Tech/AI.
  - **Ask questions:** Post about AI trends (e.g., “What’s the best AI tool for video editing?”) to spark discussion and learn.
  - **Share your pivot:** Talk about transitioning from film to AI, which inspires others and attracts mentors in creative tech.
- **Curate, don’t regurgitate.** It’s okay to draw from what you consume (e.g., AI blogs, X threads). The key is to add your spin: connect it to your film experience, reflect on how it applies to your internship goals, or share a personal takeaway. For example, if you read about generative AI, post: “Just explored how AI can generate scripts—reminds me of my screenplay days, but faster! Any tips for AI content roles?”

#### 2. Platform-Specific Strategies
Each platform has a different vibe, so tailor your posts to maximize value while staying authentic. Since you’re preparing for the AI event (e.g., AgentCon Cebu, September 15), use these to build momentum and network with US internship contacts.

| **Platform** | **Approach to Avoid Being “Precious”** | **Sample Post Ideas** | **Why It Works** |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **LinkedIn** (Professional, career-focused) | Share your pivot story and media skills in a conversational way. Don’t aim for polished TED Talk vibes—be real about your journey. Post 1-2 times weekly. | “Pivoting from film to AI after a wild ride writing a national screenplay. Learned resilience the hard way—now exploring AI for content creation. Excited for [Event Name] to connect! #AIInternship” OR “Tried Runway’s AI video tool—blows my mind how it streamlines editing. Any US companies hiring interns for this?” | Shows growth, ties media skills to AI, and invites connections. Recruiters search keywords like “AI” and “content creation.” |
| **X** (Fast, conversational) | Jump into discussions with quick takes or questions. Retweet AI leaders and add your thoughts. Avoid overthinking—post what excites you. | Reply to an AI thread: “As a filmmaker, I’m geeking out over AI video tools. How do you see them changing editing workflows? #GenerativeAI” OR Post: “From bombing a film project to diving into AI—biggest lesson: keep iterating. #AIJourney” | Engages real-time AI communities (e.g., #AI, #TechInternships). Short posts feel less “precious” and spark chats. |
| **Instagram** (Visual, storytelling) | Use Stories/Reels to show your media skills (e.g., quick AI-edited clips). Share your pivot casually, not as a grand announcement. | Reel: Show a 15-second AI-edited video, caption: “From film flops to AI experiments—this is my first try with Runway! #AIinMedia” OR Story: “Why AI? My editing skills found a new home. Ask me about my pivot!” | Visuals highlight your strengths. Casual tone avoids overthinking and attracts creative tech folks. |
| **TikTok** (Fun, viral) | Lean into trends or humor to share your pivot. Don’t stress originality—remix AI content with your media flair. | Video: “POV: You’re a filmmaker learning AI. *shows clip of bad edit vs. AI fix* This is why I’m hooked! #AIforCreatives” OR “3 lessons from my film fail that make me better at AI.” | Relatable, fun content stands out. Duet US AI creators to network. |
| **Facebook** (Niche groups) | Post in AI/media groups (e.g., “AI for Creatives”). Ask questions or share small wins to spark discussion, not to impress. | “Hey [Group], I’m pivoting from film to AI. Used my editing skills with Descript—any US internship tips for blending media and tech?” OR “My screenplay background makes AI content creation so exciting. What tools do you use?” | Group posts feel low-stakes and build connections with AI pros. |

#### 3. Practical Tips to Post Without Being “Precious”
- **Start small:** Don’t aim for viral hits. Share one post on LinkedIn or X today (e.g., “Just read about AI in video editing—mind blown! How’s it changing your workflow?”). Small posts build confidence.
- **Batch content:** Spend 30 minutes creating 3-5 posts (e.g., a LinkedIn update, an X question, an Instagram Story). Schedule them over the week to avoid overthinking each one.
- **Use your media skills:** Create a quick AI-related sample (e.g., a 15-second video edited with CapCut’s AI features) to share on Instagram/TikTok. This shows your value without needing “original” thoughts.
- **Engage, don’t just post:** Comment on AI leaders’ posts (e.g., US internship coordinators on LinkedIn) or reply to X threads. Engagement builds your network faster than standalone posts. Example: “Loved your post on AI ethics—how can a newbie like me get into this for internships?”
- **Own your pivot:** Share your film-to-AI story as a strength, not a flaw. Example: “My film project taught me to iterate fast—now applying that to AI tools like Runway. #AIJourney”
- **Don’t over-apologize:** As discussed, avoid public apologies about the film unless it’s trending locally (e.g., on X or in film groups). If needed, weave it subtly into a growth post: “A rough film project taught me resilience—now channeling that into AI. Excited for [Event Name]!”

#### 4. Addressing the Film Project Context
Your concern about being “unprecious” might tie to the film’s fallout and feeling like posting casually is “wrong.” Since you’re resolving this privately with crew (e.g., Renean’s group talk), you don’t need to address it publicly unless it’s widely known. If it comes up at the event, have a one-liner: “My first film was a learning curve, but it taught me skills I’m bringing to AI.” This keeps your posts focused on your Tech/AI pivot, not past mistakes.

#### 5. Tie-In to AI Networking Event (September 15-21)
To prep for the event (e.g., AgentCon Cebu), use social media to:
- **Build buzz:** Post on LinkedIn/X: “Gearing up for [Event Name] to explore AI in media. My editing background’s getting a tech upgrade—any US internship tips? #AIInternship”
- **Connect with attendees:** Search event hashtags (e.g., #AgentCon2025) on X or LinkedIn. Comment on organizers’ posts: “Excited for your talk on AI agents—any advice for a media student breaking into tech?”
- **Showcase skills:** Share a sample (e.g., AI-edited video) on Instagram/TikTok to attract creative tech pros. Caption: “Blending my film skills with AI—ready for [Event Name]!”
- **Pitch at event:** “I’m [Name], pivoting from film to AI, using my screenplay and editing skills for generative content. Seeking US internships—any leads on companies like Runway?”

### Why This Approach Works
- **Reduces pressure:** By focusing on small, authentic posts (e.g., questions, quick samples), you avoid the need to be “precious” or wildly original. Your media background already sets you apart.
- **Adds value:** Sharing your pivot, asking questions, or showcasing AI experiments (e.g., a video edit) engages audiences and builds your network for internships.
- **Aligns with goals:** Posting about your media-to-AI journey positions you as a unique candidate for US roles in creative tech, like content creation or AI video tools.
- **Manages anxiety:** Starting with low-stakes engagement (comments, Stories) and avoiding unnecessary film apologies keeps you confident.

### Action Plan (September 6-15, 2025)
- **Today (Sep 6):** Reply to Renean (as discussed) to plan the group talk. Post one X comment or LinkedIn update: “Exploring AI video tools—how do they compare to traditional editing? #AIinMedia”
- **Tomorrow (Sep 7):** Create a 15-second AI-edited video (use free tools like CapCut). Share on Instagram/TikTok with a pivot caption. Engage with one event speaker on LinkedIn/X.
- **This Week (Sep 8-12):** Post 2-3 times (e.g., LinkedIn update on AI event prep, X question about internships). Join an AI Facebook group and ask for US internship tips. Finalize group apology with crew.
- **Event Week (Sep 15-21):** Share one pre-event post: “Ready for [Event Name] to dive into AI and media! #AIInternship” Network with 5-10 pros, using your media-to-AI pitch.
