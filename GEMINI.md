# Gemini Project Log

This file tracks the changes made to the project by the Gemini AI assistant.

## Current State

The project is a multimodal AI system that can answer questions using both text documents and images. It is designed to run fully offline using local AI models.

-   **Text Analysis:** Uses a FAISS vector store with `nomic-embed-text` for text embeddings and `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_0` for text generation.
-   **Image Analysis:** Uses the `llava:13b` vision model running on Ollama.
-   **Core Logic:** The main entry point is `query.py`, which uses the `IntegratedMultimodalSystem` class to coordinate the text and image analysis.

## Changelog

### 2025-09-05

-   **Enhance Image Preprocessing:**
    -   Update the `optimize_image` function in `enhanced_local_image_analyzer.py`.
    -   Increase the maximum image resolution to 2048x2048.
    -   Apply a sharpening filter to the image to improve text clarity.

-   **Implement Incremental Updates for Vector Store:**
    -   Modified `update.py` to only process new or modified files in the `AI_Data` directory.
    -   Introduced `update_metadata.json` to store file modification timestamps for efficient tracking.
    -   This change significantly reduces the time taken for subsequent runs of `update.py` by avoiding reprocessing of unchanged files.
