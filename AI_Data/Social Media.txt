Introduction:

	Hi! I'm Bjorn, I'm a 1st Year Computer Science Student From Central Philippine University. I'm a national filmmaker that's shifted their focus onto Self Hosted AI Models. I'm currently looking for an internship, specifically in the US. How do you think I could possibly break into the US Market with the current resources we have?
